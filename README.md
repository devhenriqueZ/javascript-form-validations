# Form field validations with JavaScript
This repository contains JavaScript code to perform validations on form fields. The validations include checks for required fields, minimum and maximum values, email format, and strong password.

To use the validations, simply include the JavaScript file in your project and call the validation functions on the appropriate events (such as the form's submit event).

If you wish to contribute more validations or improvements to the code, feel free to send a pull request. Any help is welcome!
